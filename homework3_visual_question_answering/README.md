# Visual Question Answering

Welcome to the third Homework of the Artificial Neural Networks and Deep Learning course!
You have the opportunity to test what you learned during the course. We set up a competition to make things more fun! ðŸ˜Ž

You will have until the 31/01/2021 to solve a visual question answering (VQA) problem on the proposed dataset. The dataset is composed by synthetic scenes (see examples above), in which people and objects interact, and by corresponding questions, which are about the content of the images. Given an image and a question, the goal is to provide the correct answer. Answers belong to 3 possible categories: 'yes/no', 'counting' (from 0 to 5) and 'other' (e.g. colors, location, ecc.) answers. Please, find the dataset details at this link and a description on the evaluation procedure on the "Evaluation" tab. We recommend to read all the instructions carefully in all the pages. Check also the Rules.
