# Welcome to the 1st ACRE Cascade Competition!

In this competition, ACRE organizers ask you to segment RGB images to distinguish between crop, weeds, and background.

## Overview
ACRE is the Agri-food Competition for Robot Evaluation, part of the METRICS project funded by the European Unionâ€™s Horizon 2020 research and innovation program under grant agreement No 871252. Autonomous robots compete to demonstrate their ability to perform agricultural tasks (such as removing weeds or surveying crops down to individual-plant resolution). At field campaigns, participants collect data that are then made available for online competitions (Cascade Campaigns) like the one you are seeing. For more information about ACRE and METRICS visit the official website.

After years of decline, the number of undernourished people began to slowly increase again in 2015. Food Security requires that everyone can have enough food produced in a sustainable manner. The topic is increasingly gaining attention as food scarcity is worsened by a continuously growing population. Also, food production is threatened by climate change. The topic is so relevant that is part of one of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals of the UN 2030 Agenda. In particular, Food Security is a pillar of SDG number 2, Zero Hunger.

In this context, the agricultural sector is going under a process of revolution by the introduction of digital technologies. The Digital Agricultural Revolution can help to reduce the use of resources (water, fertilizers, and pesticides), thus diminishing the environmental contamination and the costs for the farmers. Also, it could increase the climate resilience of crops and their productivity.

Automatic crop and weed segmentation can be a driver of innovations to optimize the agricultural processes. Indeed, automatic weed detection can be exploited by a ground robot for mechanical weeding. Thus, pesticides could even be completely avoided. By joining this challenge you can contribute to advance the application of digital technologies in agriculture. We hope you will enjoy the competition :)
