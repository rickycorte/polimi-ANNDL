# Image Classification

Welcome to the first Homework of the Artificial Neural Networks and Deep Learning course!
You have the opportunity to test what you learned during the course. We set up a competition to make things more fun! ðŸ˜Ž

You will have 2 weeks to solve an image classification problem on the proposed dataset. In particular, you are required to classify images depicting groups of people based on the number of masked people. In the specific, your solution must discriminate between images depending on the following cases: 1) All the people in the image are wearing a mask, 2) No person in the image is wearing a mask, 3) Someone in the image is not wearing a mask. In the following 3 examples of image from the training belonging to the three cases (Up-Left (1), Up-Right (3), Bottom (2)).

Thus, the classification is performed on 3 different classes. Being a classification problem, given an image, the goal is to predict the correct class label. Please, find the dataset details at this link and a description on the evaluation procedure on the "Evaluation" tab. We recommend to read all the instructions carefully in all the pages.
